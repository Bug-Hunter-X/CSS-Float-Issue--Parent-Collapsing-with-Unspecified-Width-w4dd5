The following CSS rule may cause unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This can occur when the parent container doesn't have an explicitly set width.  The `float: left;` property will cause the div to take up only the necessary width (50%), but the parent will collapse if its width isn't specified.
